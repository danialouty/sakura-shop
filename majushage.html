            <p>The red spider lily is a strange, captivating flower native to Japan. It’s common to see their blooms near graveyards in autumn, which has earned them the connotation with death, the afterlife, and abandonment. Japanese people often use red spider lilies at funerals rather than as gifts.
                When the petals bloom, the lily’s leaves die. By the time the leaves grow, the flower has already wilted. This unusual characteristic led to a myth of lovers cursed by the gods to never meet again, and the Japanese name majushage is the combination of these lovers’ names.</p>
