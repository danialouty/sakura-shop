            <p >  Sakura, also known as cherry blossoms, are the iconic light pink flowers that come to mind for most people when they think of Japanese scenery. The flowers only bloom for a brief time during spring, and their fleeting nature has associated them with the concept of impermanence. In hanakotoba, cherry blossoms signify “beauty of heart” and “accomplishment.” </p>
